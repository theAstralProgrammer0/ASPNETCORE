I learned a lot trying to deploy an asp.net core application.
I wanted to use the asp.net core SDK 9.0 docker container image to build my asp.net core application.
Trying to do this made me go through a learning experience with docker.
I realized you can spin up docker applications in various ways.
The journey first starts from getting an asp.net core project going, which entails having an asp.net core sdk verion for building it.
The sdk's image is what I need from docker.
I pulled the image so i could use it locally. Apparently, directly editing the /var/lib/docker file where image layer information 
and metadata are stored could corrupt my Docker installation...yikes
The closest I could get to accessing pulled docker container image was using 'docker image inspect <container_url>'
and 'docker history <container_url> to view some redundant information.
Anyways, after pulling the image, I had to use it right?
Using it took me over a day to figure out how to use it to my satisfaction.
My goal was to have a way to build my app using the sdk anytime I wanted in a shell environment.
I also wanted custom configurations for the ports mapping from the container to my host machine, and finally, 
I wanted persistence for my app's data and filesystem  so I don't loose the work I already did.
These made me realized soon enough that I needed to either write a DockerFile, 
or specify the configurations of the sdk container instance in a docker-compose.yml so I didn't have to repeatedly do it.
The direct way was executing 'docker run -it -v <host_path>:<container_path> -p <host_port>:<container_port>' 
every single time I wanted to spin up the sdk container for building the app.
Recall, why I needed the sdk is that it allows me build dotnet apps quickly which is the goal in the first place.
Plus, I wouldn't ever have to locally install dotnet on my machine, just spin up the sdk and build. Running it is an entirely different story though.
After realizing the direct way was not sustainable, I figured a docker-compose.yml file can be use to state preset configurations for any image.
Its kind of like using a vagrant file to specify the properties of the virtual machine you want spun up.
Hence, I had to install docker-compose locally by getting the binary file for my linux machine's architecture (x86_64)and renaming it.
In Linux systems, the machine's info can be obtain using 'uname --m' other info can be viewed using 'uname --a'
Essentially, the docker-compose.yml file is a universally recognised filename in the docker-compose ecosystem, 
so when I was ready to spin up the container, I just needed to execute 'docker-compose up --build' or simply 'docker-compose up'.
Apparently, this step is absolutely necessary for me to properly utilize virtual network resources like port mapping from the docker container to my host.
Now, this is where things get interesting.
The docker-compose.yml file can have services.
Different services are denoted using the service keyword and proper indentation (as in yml files). 
The name of the service comes first as the first key within the service block.
Then, within that name block, other keys such as 
image, ports, volumes, environment, working_dir, and command 
are useful (sometime necessary) fields for specify preset values.
My docker-compose.yml for the app was:
```YAML
services:
  tutorialapp:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0
    working_dir: /app/aspnetcoreapp
    ports:
      - "5070:5070"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:5070
    command: dotnet run --urls "http://0.0.0.0:5070"
```

services - Defines the services the docker-compose.yml can render
tutorialapp - My chosen name for the sdk image's configuration
image - Either the name of the container image or the container's url (preferred)
ports - Used to define the port mapping config. Format is <port_on_host>:<port_on_container>
volumes - Used to mount some memory on the container to persist the data and filesystem of the project. Format is <path_on_host>:<path_on_container>
environment - Used to define environment variables for the container.
command - Used to execute command(s) on the container immediately it is spun up.

After spinning up the sdk container image, I could then access the filesystem used to build asp.net core web apps.
To run the web app on a development server, I had to build the app first.

First, execute 'dotnet new webapp --output aspnetcoreapp --no-https' to scaffold out a new webapp 
with the necessary file-folder structure required to build a webapp.

Next, 'cd aspnetcoreapp' && 'dotnet run --urls "http://0.0.0.0:5070"' to start the app.
The '--urls "http://0.0.0.0:5070"' option was specified in the command field because ASP.NET Core's default server (Kestrel) has to 
bind to all network interfaces not just the localhost on docker where its running and listening for inbound or outbound traffic.

Note: A server binding to all network interfaces means that it allows traffic from and to any host that exists in its network 
(i.e to all available IP addresses on the container).
In this specific case, the Kestrel server running on the Docker container binds (allows connection from and) to all network interfaces (e.g., localhost).

This configuration of the Kestrel server is specified in the TCP/IP address "http://0.0.0.0:5070" by the IP part "0.0.0.0".
This IP is a special type of IP address that tells a server to listen for traffic coming from any IP address on the container its being run.
This includes the container's internal IP address (localhost -> 127.0.0.1) and the Docker bridge network which is any 
The port part (5070) tells the Kestrel server to listen on port 5070. Docker container running the Kestrel server,
for receiving and sending traffic over all network interfaces. 
Kestrel, the development server which runs on the docker container is using docker's bridge network via port 5070 .
This can also be specified in the "command" field of the <custom_service> fiels of the "services" field of the docker-compose.yml file 
to fast track the process as in the docker-compose.yml file for the tutorial app I built.
